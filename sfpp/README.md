# `sim/` - the Meshtastic mesh simulator and the SF++ set-reconciliation campaign

Operating manual for the research simulator under `sim/`. This documents a **tool**, not a firmware
feature: the repository's house rule (no design, API or wire-format documents in the tree) still
holds, and anything about what SF++ _is_ belongs in the docs repo. What follows is how to drive the
thing.

`sim/meshtasticator/` is vendored upstream and carries its own README.

---

## 1. What it is, and what it is not

A discrete-event simulator for a Meshtastic mesh, with the SF++ archive protocols running on top as
real traffic. Three layers, and the separation matters when reading a result:

| Layer           | File                                | What it decides                                                                                                           |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Physics**     | vendored `meshtasticator/lib/`      | who can hear whom, how long a packet holds the channel, whether a marginal link decodes                                   |
| **Transport**   | `sfpp/mesh.py`                      | the firmware's MAC and routing: CAD, TX queue, contention window, duplicate suppression, next-hop routing, hop accounting |
| **Application** | `sfpp/campaign.py`, `sfpp/chain.py` | the archive protocols - set reconciliation, and the chain walk it aims to replace                                         |

**Exactly three things are imported from the vendored tree**: `lib.phy` (path loss, airtime),
`lib.config` (presets, regions), `lib.radio_loss` (the SNR-to-PER curve). All physics. The vendored
tree's own discrete-event simulator - `discrete_event_sim.py`, `mac.py`, `node.py`, `packet.py` - is
**upstream's, models roughly 2.1-era behaviour, and is never called by anything here.** If you are
looking for firmware behaviour, it is in `sfpp/mesh.py` and nowhere else.

**It is not** regulatory evidence, a substitute for hardware, or a model of mobility. Terrain and
clutter are modelled only when `--scenario` asks for them (§5.1h); without it the world is flat.
Duty cycle is not enforced: airtime figures are what the protocol _asks for_, not what a region
permits, though `node_air_util_tx_percent` now reports what each node would have to declare.
**§10 is the full list of what is simplified, assumed and absent, and every result from this tool is
bounded by it.**

### The two rules the transport is held to

Everything in `sfpp/mesh.py` obeys these. They are not style preferences - most of the real bugs
found in this simulator have been one of them broken somewhere, and each looked like a plausible
number until it was traced back.

**1. A node knows only what it can hear or perceive.** No node reads another's state, another's
position, or the shape of the mesh. What this looks like in practice:

- a relay byte is one byte, so two peers can share it and the receiver cannot tell which sent -
  `resolve_unique_last_byte` returns nothing rather than guessing;
- a traceroute is believed only where the immediate relay corroborates it, because the rest of the
  path is hearsay;
- an evicted peer is forgotten, and a stored route decays on its own clocks, because a node cannot
  know a route went stale;
- channel utilisation is the union of the stretches the radio sensed occupied, not the sum of the
  transmissions it could hear. **A receiver cannot count the transmitters it collided with**: it has
  one energy detector, and on failure it learns that an Rx failed, not why or how many were talking.
  That one was wrong until `18a7293`, and read as 184% of wall-clock before it was found.

**2. Only the observer has full knowledge, and only ever for measurement.** The run computes
quantities no device could: `truth`, the topological distance to every reachable node; the
reachability ceiling; the union across archives; the silent-loss audit. **None of them may reach a
decision a node makes** - they exist so a result can be compared against what was actually possible.
If an omniscient quantity starts feeding behaviour, the run stops measuring the protocol and starts
measuring the observer.

(Unrelated naming: `sfpp/oracle.cpp` and `check_oracle.py` are a differential test of the PinSketch
port against the firmware's C++, not the observer described here.)

### The one gap worth knowing before you read any result

**There is no client hydration path.** Archives accumulate messages and reconcile with each other, and
nothing models a client asking a server for what it missed. So `held` and `union` are what an archive
_has_, not what a user _gets_. The only measured end-user gain is bystander pickup - a node overhearing
a replayed object and filing it via the replay header.

---

## 2. Quick start

Nothing needs installing. The simulator and its tests are standard library only, as are the three
vendored modules they import. `requirements.txt` lists two optional extras - matplotlib for the
charts, pytest for a shorter test run - and the code degrades rather than fails without either.

```bash
cd sim
python3 -m unittest discover -s sfpp -t . -p 'test_*.py'   # a gate, not a formality
python3 -m pytest sfpp -q                                  # the same suite, shorter output

# one scenario. JSON, statistics report and charts are all written by the run itself
python3 -m sfpp.campaign --hours 24 --seed 1 --protocol sr --out /tmp/r/run.json

# a swept arm, three seeds; same three outputs per block
python3 -m sfpp.sweep --list
python3 -m sfpp.sweep --block Q-protocol --seeds 3 --seed-base 990001 --out /tmp/r

# long work that must survive the shell that started it
./run-blocks.sh /tmp/r 440001 R-oversubscribed R-congestion-input R-srretries
./run-blocks.sh --status /tmp/r
```

A run leaves three things beside each other, and needs no post-processing step to be readable:

```
/tmp/r/run.json            the full report
/tmp/r/reports/run.txt     the per-portnum statistics, text marked and first
/tmp/r/figures/run.png     the charts, footered with commit, seed and duration
```

## 3. Operating functions

| Module            | Run as                 | Purpose                                                                           |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `campaign.py`     | `-m sfpp.campaign`     | one scenario end to end; writes JSON, report and charts                          |
| `sweep.py`        | `-m sfpp.sweep`        | a named block: one arm, several values, shared seeds; same three outputs         |
| `report.py`       | `-m sfpp.report`       | per-portnum statistics as distributions, text marked and first                    |
| `analyse.py`      | `-m sfpp.analyse`      | markdown tables from saved JSON, re-tabulated without re-running                  |
| `autochart.py`    | (automatic)            | charts rendered by the run that produced the data                                 |
| `tuning.py`       | `-m sfpp.tuning`       | recommended values with evidence, confidence, and what would overturn each        |
| `figures.py`      | `-m sfpp.figures`      | the earlier rounds' block figures (reach, cadence, resolve, capacity, loss, place) |
| `figures3.py`     | `-m sfpp.figures3`     | the campaign's set-piece figures (mesh shapes, protocol comparison, coverage gap) |
| `experiment.py`   | `-m sfpp.experiment`   | one-off comparisons that are not worth a named block                             |
| `diagram.py`      | `-m sfpp.diagram`      | draws a mesh's link graph, for checking a topology rather than a result          |
| `check_oracle.py` | `-m sfpp.check_oracle` | compiles `PinSketch.cpp` and diffs it against `pinsketch.py`                      |
| `knowledge.py`    | (library)              | per-node NodeDB state, partitions, stale beliefs                                  |
| `analytic/`       | `-m sfpp.analytic.*`   | pre-transport closed-form and Monte-Carlo models, kept as a cross-check           |
| `run-blocks.sh`   | `./run-blocks.sh`      | detached runner: `setsid`, a lock, a manifest, and a test gate                    |

**Both `campaign.py` and `sweep.py` write their own JSON, statistics report and charts.** That is
deliberate: an unattended or remote run has to leave a complete, readable result behind without
anyone remembering a second command, and its stdout is not always kept. `report.py` and `analyse.py`
remain for re-tabulating saved JSON without re-running it, not for making a run readable in the
first place.

The two `figures*.py` tools are the exception - they draw from blocks pinned by name, so they take
`--runs` and `--out` and say which file they wanted rather than skipping in silence. A block run
under `--grid` carries the grid in its filename, which is the usual reason one is not found.

`python3 -m sfpp.sweep --list` prints the named blocks.

## 4. Every parameter

### 4.1 Mesh shape and size

| Flag                     | Default          | Meaning                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--nodes`                | 60               | node count                                                                                                            |
| `--area`                 | 8000             | side of the placement square, metres                                                                                  |
| `--scale-area`           | off              | grow the area as √(n/60) so **density is held constant**. Without it, a size sweep measures density and calls it size |
| `--topology`             | `uniform`        | see §5                                                                                                                |
| `--stretch`              | 1.0              | scale every distance by this factor, about the centroid, **after** placement. Unlike `--area` it keeps the same nodes in the same arrangement, so an arm is paired with its own control. Read `report["stretch"]` and see §5.1e |
| `--router-fraction`      | 0.1              | share promoted to ROUTER, chosen by degree                                                                            |
| `--router-late-fraction` | 0.0              | share as ROUTER_LATE                                                                                                  |
| `--client-base-fraction` | 0.0              | share as CLIENT_BASE                                                                                                  |
| `--role-mix`             | empty            | named role census, e.g. `baymesh-2026-08`. Empty keeps `--router-fraction` and the other shares                       |
| `--platform-mix`         | `uniform`        | board mix; decides each node's hot-store size. Inert unless `--max-num-nodes` is left unset          |
| `--siting-mix`           | `uniform`        | where nodes physically are, as a per-node gain offset. **Assumed, not measured** - see §10          |
| `--role-placement`       | `degree`         | where the router-like roles go: `degree` on the best-connected nodes as an operator would, `inverse` on the worst, `random` to separate the role from its usual siting |
| `--amplifier-mix`        | `none`           | power amplifiers as **separate transmit and receive gain**: `modest` +8/0 dB, `high` +15/0, `lossy` +15/−3. Mixes: `sprinkled`, `arms-race`. **Assumed, not measured** |
| `--amplify-worst`        | 0.0              | fit a high amplifier to this share of the worst-connected nodes, after the links exist. The field pathology: the node nobody can hear gets a PA and is then heard by everyone while still hearing almost nobody |
| `--admin-probes-per-hour` | 0.0             | attempt this many admin sessions per hour, spread over 1..N hops of separation. A session is a PKI DM out and a reply back, and **both legs must land** |
| `--admin-max-hops`       | 5                | the largest separation admin sessions are attempted at |
| `--admin-attempts`       | 3                | how many times an operator presses a change before giving up. **Not a firmware constant** - the firmware has no retry loop here - so it is an assumption about the person. Each attempt gets the firmware's own 300 s outstanding-request window (`AdminModule.h:109`) |
| `--no-admin-preloaded-keys` | on | gate admin sessions on the hot store's PKI keys. The default does not, and that is **firmware-authentic**: admin authorisation is `config.security.admin_key[3]` in SecurityConfig (`AdminModule.cpp:184`), separate persistent config that NodeDB eviction cannot touch - so a session's outcome is its timing, not key availability. Pass this to measure the eviction question instead |
| `--favourite-routers`    | off              | router-like nodes favourite each other, so relays between them keep their hop limit                                   |

### 4.2 Hop limits

| Flag                               | Default      | Meaning                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--hop-limit`                      | 3            | one limit for every node                                                                                                                                |
| `--hop-spread` / `--no-hop-spread` | **on**       | per-node limits 3-7                                                                                                                                     |
| `--hop-assign`                     | `centrality` | `centrality` is realistic (edge nodes raise theirs) but confounds hop limit with position; `random` is the control that isolates the limit's own effect |

### 4.3 Radio and firmware behaviour

| Flag                        | Default      | Meaning                                                                                          |
| --------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--preset`                  | `LONG_FAST`  | modem preset, **one per mesh**. **Changes reception, not just airtime** - see §6 and §5.1c. Seven the firmware ships were missing from the vendored table and are now present; two more are ours and not upstream |
| `--tx-power`                | region limit | transmit power in dBm. The region limit is a ceiling an operator may use, not one they must    |
| `--profile`                 | `2.8`        | which release series' rules to obey: `2.4` … `2.8`, or `legacy`. See §9.1                        |
| `--old-profile`             | `legacy`     | the rules the `--legacy-fraction` share runs instead. Inert at `--legacy-fraction 0`             |
| `--legacy-fraction`         | 0.0          | share of nodes on `--old-profile`, drawn at random not by degree                                 |
| `--profile-flag NAME=VALUE` | -            | override one rule, repeatable. A specific pathology lives here rather than as a fake version     |
| `--rebroadcast-mode`        | `ALL`        | `ALL`, `ALL_SKIP_DECODING`, `LOCAL_ONLY`, `KNOWN_ONLY`, `CORE_PORTNUMS_ONLY`, `NONE`             |
| `--max-num-nodes`           | 120          | modelled `MAX_NUM_NODES`. Sizes the hot store **and** bounds the congestion input                |
| `--warm-num-nodes`          | from board   | `WARM_NODE_COUNT`: identities kept for peers evicted from hot, so a DM still encrypts. 0 disables |
| `--signature-policy`        | `COMPATIBLE` | `config.security.packet_signature_policy` on receive: `COMPATIBLE`, `BALANCED`, `STRICT`         |
| `--traceroute-per-hour`     | 0.0          | route discoveries per node per hour - what seeding next-hop routing costs                        |
| `--trace-interval-s`        | 0            | sample every adaptive quantity per node this often and keep the series; 0 disables               |
| `--no-adopt-hop-recommendation` | off      | compute the hop recommendation but do not apply it, as the control                               |
| `--dm-transport`            | `hop-by-hop` | `transport` routes an addressed SR message through next-hop routing and its retry ladder         |
| `--dm-mode`                 | `directed-with-late-flood` | how a DM escalates. Inert unless `--dm-transport transport`                         |
| `--coding-rate-ladder`      | off          | raise the coding rate on each retransmission. Not in any release                                 |
| `--extra-repeats`           | off          | tolerate a second heard copy before cancelling our own rebroadcast. Not in any release           |
| `--congestion-mode`         | `adaptive`   | recompute the broadcast throttle per node from its own online count, or one mesh-wide value      |
| `--no-phy-loss`             | off          | disable the empirical SNR-to-PER curve                                                           |

**On `--profile`.** Each value is a **release series taken at its final release**, dated by walking
the firmware's own tags. `2.8` is this tree, read line by line; `2.4` through `2.7` turn off the
behaviours that arrived after that series. `legacy` is **not a firmware version** - it is this
simulator's own pre-fold-in transport, kept so a result can be attributed to a rule change rather
than to the rewrite around it. §9.1 has the full register and §10.2 what each profile is confident
about.

Useful individual flags: `clamp_cw=true` restores the unclamped Arduino `map()` contention window,
`router_cw_floor=true` the old router-pinned window, `max_backoffs=400` the defect that discarded two
thirds of rebroadcast attempts.

### 4.4 Offered load

| Flag                                          | Default       | Meaning                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--broadcast-interval-s`                      | per-class mix | one interval for every device class. **This is the denominator every airtime share is quoted against**                                       |
| `--diurnal`                                   | `commuter`    | `flat`, `sinusoid`, `commuter` (17:1 peak-to-trough). Applies to text, position and DMs - human traffic - not to telemetry or nodeinfo, which a device reports on a timer regardless of the hour. **Nearly inert on a run shorter than a day**: a 2 h run samples two hours of a 24 h curve |
| `--dm-per-hour`                               | 0.0           | direct messages per originating node per hour. Both ends drawn from CLIENT and CLIENT_MUTE only - a router is infrastructure, and the addressed traffic it sees in the field is an admin session. PKI, `want_ack`, so they exercise next-hop routing and the retry ladder rather than the flood |
| `--dm-originator-fraction`                    | 1.0           | share of nodes anyone ever types on. Below 1.0 sprinkles unattended nodes - a solar repeater, a sensor, an owner who reads and never writes - which still relay and are still valid destinations, but never start a conversation |

**The ground under the mesh** (§5.1h). Terrain, land cover, and real node geometry. Without
`--scenario` the world is flat and every figure below is inert, which is what every run before this

`--stretch` is refused on a real-geometry scenario rather than ignored: moving Batumi's nodes apart
makes it somewhere else, and the result would still be labelled `batumi`.

## 5. Topologies and placements

### 5.1 Mesh shapes - `--topology`

At 60 nodes, seed 990001, 8 km:

| Value       | Shape                          | Degree     | Diameter | Why it is a different question                                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ | ---------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `uniform`   | Poisson-disc across the square | 8.7         | 7        | the control, and the only shape rounds one and two ever ran                       |
| `clustered` | _k_ towns, sparse between      | 20.4        | 5        | what most regional meshes look like; between-town links are the bottleneck        |
| `corridor`  | long and thin, aspect 6:1      | 8.4         | 12       | a valley or coast road; hop limit binds hard, placement is nearly one-dimensional |
| `hub`       | dense core plus radial spokes  | 18.2        | 5        | the core hears everything, the spoke ends almost nothing                          |
| `chain`     | towns strung in a line         | 10.6 @16 km | **11**   | **the way to build a mesh wider than any hop limit that stays connected**         |
| `mixed`     | drawn from the seed            | -          | -        | a sweep samples across _shapes_ rather than draws of one shape                    |

**Use `chain`, not a stretched `uniform`, for wide meshes.** Stretching a uniform field far enough to
exceed seven hops fragments it: at 16 km with 60 nodes it falls into 15 components at degree 2.6,
where `chain` over the same span stays in one piece at degree 10.6 with a diameter of 11. A diameter
measured across a fragmented graph is the diameter of whichever fragment the walk started in.
`link_stats()` reports `components`, `largest_component` and `connected`, and `diameter()` returns
`None` rather than a misleading number when the mesh is not connected.

### 5.1a Adversarial meshes

Most named mixes describe a mesh somebody has. These describe one nobody would build on purpose, and
exist to find the floor a design has to clear rather than to predict a deployment.

| Knob | Value | What it removes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--role-mix no-mute` | 81% CLIENT, 16% CLIENT_BASE, 2% ROUTER, 1% ROUTER_LATE | **`CLIENT_MUTE` entirely.** A fifth of Baymesh does not rebroadcast at all; deleting that is the single cruellest realistic change to a role census |
| `--role-mix all-routers` | every node ROUTER | the contention-window offset a client pays, and every rebroadcast delay with it |
| `--role-placement inverse` | routers on the worst-connected nodes | the operator's judgement - this is what happens when someone flashes ROUTER onto the node they already own |
| `--siting-mix basement-heavy` | 50% basement, 30% pocket, 20% desk | the assumption that nodes are somewhere sensible |
| `--siting-mix worst-case` | 80% basement, 20% pocket | any node that can hear well. **Not a deployment** - a floor |

Measured at 60 nodes, 8 km, seed 9, 6 h, against `baymesh-2026-08` with `uniform` siting:

| Mesh | Degree | text p10 | median | p90 | node util | transmissions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| baseline | 9.2 | 0.587 | 0.751 | 0.836 | 26.2% | 22 564 |
| no `CLIENT_MUTE` | 9.2 | **0.682** | 0.807 | 0.884 | 27.7% | 25 210 |
| every node a ROUTER | 9.2 | 0.691 | 0.778 | 0.887 | **66.9%** | **58 142** |
| routers on the worst nodes | 9.2 | 0.635 | 0.709 | 0.783 | 23.9% | 22 601 |
| `local-typical` siting | 7.5 | 0.413 | 0.698 | 0.762 | 24.1% | 26 059 |
| `basement-heavy` siting | **1.2** | **0.000** | 0.000 | 0.307 | 0.4% | 11 637 |

Three things worth knowing before using these:

- **`CLIENT_MUTE` is decided by density, not by siting.** Crossed at 80 nodes, 8 h, seed 9:

  | siting | roles | degree | text p10 | median | p90 | cancellations |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | `uniform` | with mute | 12.7 | **0.768** | 0.848 | 0.900 | 44 359 |
  | `uniform` | no mute | 12.7 | 0.757 | 0.867 | 0.921 | 57 893 |
  | `local-typical` | with mute | 9.4 | 0.361 | 0.691 | 0.754 | 36 509 |
  | `local-typical` | no mute | 9.4 | **0.458** | 0.759 | 0.803 | 41 468 |

  On the dense mesh removing mute costs p10 while raising median and p90 - the well-placed gain and
  the badly-placed lose. On the sparser one it gains p10 outright, and by a lot. Bad siting makes
  the mesh sparser, and a sparse mesh needs every relay it can get, so **`local-typical` does not
  make muting more attractive; it makes it less**. The crossover here sits between degree 9.4 and
  12.7.

- **Duplicate suppression does backfire, and it is measurable.** A relay heard by fewer nodes than
  the one whose rebroadcast it cancels suppresses a broadcast that would have travelled further than
  its own. `cancelled_by_weaker_relay` counts those and `cancelled_reach_lost` sums the neighbours
  given up: on 80 nodes with `local-typical` siting and no mute, **43% of all cancellations are of
  this kind, each costing about 4.8 nodes of onward reach**.

  That is a large number and it is still not decisive - the coverage those relays add outweighs the
  suppression they cause everywhere except the dense mesh above. Read the counters to understand
  *why* an arm moved, not to predict which way it will. `all-routers` is the same trade once more:
  nearly `no-mute`'s reception for 2.6x the transmissions and 67% node utilisation.
- **`inverse` levels rather than lowers**: p10 rises to 0.635 while p90 falls to 0.783. A router on
  a fringe node helps the fringe and stops helping the core. Adversarial for the well-connected.
- **`basement-heavy` does not stress the mesh, it kills it.** Siting gain applies at both ends of a
  link, so two basement nodes are 40 dB down and degree collapses to 1.2. Nothing is delivered
  because there is no mesh left. Use `local-typical` for a hard-but-alive mesh; `worst-case` is a
  connectivity floor, not a traffic experiment.

### 5.1b Can an operator actually administer this mesh?

A configuration change is not a broadcast some nodes may miss - it is a round trip that has to
complete. `--admin-probes-per-hour` sends a PKI-encrypted AdminMessage to a node at a chosen hop
distance and has the target answer; **either leg failing means the session failed**. At 60 nodes,
8 h, seed 5:

| hops | tried | no key | addressable | completed | overall | given key |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 54 | 21 | 33 | 17 | 31% | **52%** |
| 2 | 65 | 31 | 34 | 13 | 20% | 38% |
| 3 | 67 | 34 | 33 | 4 | 6% | 12% |
| 4 | 71 | 40 | 31 | 8 | 11% | 26% |
| 5 | 52 | 26 | 26 | 4 | 8% | 15% |

Two failures, and they want reading apart. **Roughly half of all attempts are never composed at
all** - PKI needs the target's public key, and a node the source has never heard from, or has
evicted, cannot be addressed however well connected it is. That is `no_key_for_target`, and it gets
worse as the mesh outgrows the hot store. `success_given_key` removes it and leaves what the mesh's
reach alone costs: even one hop away and holding the key, only about half of round trips complete.

The probe picks targets by *topological* distance, not by what the source has heard of, so it asks
nodes to administer strangers. That is deliberate - it is the case an operator hits - but it means
`success_rate` is a floor and `success_given_key` the more comparable number across arms.

**SIMPLIFICATION:** the firmware's admin flow also carries a session key with its own expiry and a
nonce exchange, and real config payloads span several packets. This measures whether the round trip
is deliverable, not whether the whole session protocol completes.

### 5.1c Presets past the shipped set

`EXTRA_LONG_TURBO` and `EXTRA_SHORT_TURBO` are **not in any firmware build.** They extend the
vendored table's own 500 kHz rows one spreading factor past each end, so a future-mesh block can ask
what a different point on the curve would buy.

| Preset | SF | BW | Sensitivity | Airtime 60 B | Degree | Diameter |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `EXTRA_SHORT_TURBO` | 5 | 500 kHz | −113.5 | 20 ms | 1.4 | fragmented |
| `SHORT_TURBO` | 7 | 500 kHz | −118.5 | 60 ms | 2.2 | fragmented |
| `LONG_FAST` | 11 | 250 kHz | −131.5 | 1264 ms | 8.9 | 7 |
| `LONG_TURBO` | 11 | 500 kHz | −128.5 | 804 ms | 6.7 | 9 |
| `EXTRA_LONG_TURBO` | 12 | 500 kHz | −131.0 | 1509 ms | 8.5 | 7 |

**Sensitivity is extrapolated, not calculated.** The vendored figures come from an external
calculator; across the 500 kHz rows they fall about 2.5 dB per spreading factor, and these continue
that slope. Indicative of direction, not a link budget.

`EXTRA_LONG_TURBO` turns out to be close to a wash against `LONG_FAST`: SF12 at 500 kHz has the same
symbol time as SF11 at 250 kHz, so the extra bandwidth buys back exactly what the extra spreading
costs, and CR8 then makes it slightly longer. Worth knowing before reading the block.

Also: **SF5 and SF6 need an SX126x or SX128x.** An SX127x cannot do them at all, so
`EXTRA_SHORT_TURBO` is not a setting every board could take even if the firmware offered it.

### 5.1c-2 The presets the firmware ships, and the range meshes actually run

A mesh runs **one preset at a time**, so `--preset` is a global and a preset comparison is between
runs, never a mix within one.

The vendored table carried ten presets. `src/mesh/MeshRadio.h`'s `modemPresetToParams` offers
seventeen, and seven of the missing ones are now here - **real, not extrapolated**. Bandwidth,
spreading factor and coding rate are read straight out of that switch; sensitivity is derived as
kTB + 6 dB NF + the demodulator limit for the spreading factor, which reproduces all ten vendored rows
to within **0.041 dB** and is what licenses deriving the rest the same way.

| preset | SF | BW | CR | sensitivity | 60 B | 237 B | note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SHORT_TURBO` | 7 | 500k | 5 | −118.50 | 0.060 s | 0.175 s | |
| `MEDIUM_TURBO` | 9 | 500k | 5 | −123.51 | 0.195 s | 0.554 s | **added** |
| `LONG_TURBO` | 11 | 500k | 8 | −128.50 | 0.804 s | 2.377 s | |
| `SHORT_FAST` | 7 | 250k | 5 | −121.50 | 0.120 s | 0.351 s | the fast end of deployed |
| `LONG_FAST` | 11 | 250k | 5 | −131.50 | 1.264 s | 3.623 s | the default |
| `LONG_MODERATE` | 11 | 125k | 8 | −134.50 | 3.805 s | 11.670 s | the slow end of deployed |
| `LITE_FAST` | 9 | 125k | 5 | −129.53 | 0.779 s | 2.217 s | **added** - the `EU_866` default |
| `LITE_SLOW` | 10 | 125k | 5 | −132.03 | 1.411 s | 3.992 s | **added** |
| `NARROW_FAST` | 7 | 62.5k | 6 | −127.54 | 0.529 s | 1.553 s | **added** |
| `NARROW_SLOW` | 8 | 62.5k | 6 | −130.04 | 0.935 s | 2.737 s | **added** - the `EU_N_868` default |
| `TINY_FAST` / `TINY_SLOW` | 7 / 8 | 15.6k | 5 / 6 | −133.6 / −136.1 | | 4.1 s / 11.0 s | **added** |

**Which of these a result should be about:**

- **Deployed meshes run `SHORT_FAST` through `LONG_MODERATE`**, with `LONG_FAST` the default and the
  middle. That is the range `P-preset` sweeps.
- **Above about 30 nodes nothing slower than `LONG_MODERATE` is used**, and meshes that do use one
  suffer for it. `LONG_SLOW` holds the channel for 21 s at a full payload; §5.1f's periodic profile
  shows `LONG_MODERATE` already losing 100% of full payloads to a 10 s interferer.
- **North America is heading for 500 kHz across the board** - `P-bw500` holds bandwidth there and
  varies spreading factor.
- **Europe stays on 250 kHz and adds the narrow presets.** `EU_866` defaults to `LITE_FAST` and
  `EU_N_868` to `NARROW_SLOW` (`src/mesh/RadioInterface.cpp:144-145`), so a European result covering
  only the 250 kHz presets is a result about the past. That is `P-eu-presets`.
- `LONG_SLOW`, `VERY_LONG_SLOW` and the two `EXTRA_` presets remain available to `--preset`. A result
  on them is a result about a mesh nobody runs, and the report says so: `outside_deployed_range` is
  null for a combination a real mesh is in and carries a sentence naming the problem otherwise. Not a
  guard - a run may ask about anything - but an out-of-range number cannot then be quoted as though it
  came from a deployed mesh.

The wideLora (2.4 GHz) bandwidths in the same switch - 1625, 812.5, 406.25 kHz - are **not** here,
because the vendored region table has no 2.4 GHz entry to run them against.

**The overlap window is now derived from the preset, not a constant.** It was `MAX_AIRTIME_MS =
20000.0`, justified by a comment claiming "LONG_SLOW at a full payload is about 6 s". It is **21.0 s**;
6 s is what a 45 B payload costs, and a 0 B frame already costs 2.50 s. So 20 s was not a wide margin -
it sat *under* LONG_SLOW's longest frame and far under `VERY_LONG_SLOW`'s 35.7 s, and a transmission
still in flight past the window was dropped from the interferer scan. Over 8 h at 30 nodes, LONG_SLOW's
longest frame was 19.80 s (about 1% of headroom, nothing over) but **`VERY_LONG_SLOW` put 130 of 5669
transmissions past it** - the longest ones, and so the likeliest to overlap something.

One constant cannot be right here: the span across presets is two orders of magnitude. `Mesh` now
sizes its own window at one maximum-length frame plus a fifth, which fixes the slow end and makes the
fast end much cheaper - a `SHORT_TURBO` delivery used to scan 20 s of history to find overlaps with a
0.175 s frame:

| preset | max frame | overlap window |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SHORT_TURBO` | 0.18 s | 0.21 s |
| `LONG_FAST` | 3.62 s | 4.35 s |
| `LONG_MODERATE` | 11.67 s | 14.00 s |
| `VERY_LONG_SLOW` | 35.67 s | 42.80 s |

### 5.1d The noise floor, and why there were no marginal links

Two questions worth answering together, because one bug caused both.

**Does wider bandwidth model more noise?** Under `--noise-model fixed`, no. Thermal noise is kTB, so
doubling the bandwidth costs 3 dB, and a single constant cannot be right for 62.5 kHz and 500 kHz at
once. The vendored constant is anchored near 100 kHz.

**Does the model work down to the demodulator limits?** The PER curve does - its p50 sits at −17.0 dB
(CR5) to −19.4 (CR8), which is exactly where LoRa stops working, and it is floored at 2% and capped
at 99.5%. But under a fixed floor the simulation never visits that region.

| Preset | BW | Sensitivity | SNR the model computes | True kTB+6 SNR | LoRa limit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `VERY_LONG_SLOW` | 62.5k | −140.0 | −20.75 | **−20.0** | −20.0 |
| `LONG_FAST` | 250k | −131.5 | −12.25 | **−17.5** | −17.5 |
| `LONG_TURBO` | 500k | −128.5 | −9.25 | **−17.5** | −17.5 |
| `SHORT_TURBO` | 500k | −118.5 | +0.75 | **−7.5** | −7.5 |

The vendored sensitivity table is internally consistent and correct - every "true" column lands on
the demodulator limit. It is the fixed noise floor that disagrees with it.

**This is why there was no marginal link.** With a fixed floor, a LONG_FAST link at sensitivity
computes SNR −12.25 dB and decodes 96% of the time - 5 dB into the flat top of the PER curve. With a
thermal floor it computes −17.5 dB and decodes **39%**. The threshold lands on the curve's knee
instead of past it, which is where links that work a third of the time come from.

| Preset | success at sensitivity, `fixed` | `thermal` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LONG_FAST` | 0.964 | **0.388** |
| `LONG_TURBO` | 0.995 | **0.386** |
| `EXTRA_LONG_TURBO` | 0.974 | **0.095** |
| `VERY_LONG_SLOW` | 0.058 | 0.097 |

The link *graph* is unchanged either way - `neighbours` is thresholded on RSSI against sensitivity
and never consults the noise floor - so degree, diameter and the margin bands are identical. Only
delivery changes.

**Everything measured before this defaulted to `fixed`**, including all of round five, and is
optimistic about weak-link delivery by the margin above. The turbo presets are the worst affected.

### 5.1e Stretch: distance as its own variable

`--stretch k` multiplies every distance in the mesh by `k`, about the centroid, after the points are
drawn. `--area` cannot do this: changing the area redraws the placement, so an 8 km mesh and a 16 km
mesh at one seed are two different meshes and the difference between them is a different draw as much
as a longer link. A stretch keeps node *k* the same node in the same arrangement. It consumes no
randomness, so every arm of `X-stretch` carries the identical traffic schedule.

**Quote the result against the unstretched link set, not the live one.** The share of live links that
are bad *improves* at high stretch, because the worst links stop being links:

| stretch | live links | below 50% delivery | share of live links | per 1000 ordered pairs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.00 | 545 | 29 | 0.053 | 8.19 |
| 1.50 | 249 | 16 | 0.064 | 4.52 |
| 2.00 | 128 | 10 | 0.078 | 2.83 |
| 3.00 | 51 | 3 | **0.059** | 0.85 |

Neither column is readable across those rows. `report["stretch"]` fixes the denominator at the link
set the mesh had at stretch 1.0, recovered exactly rather than re-drawn - the per-pair skew is stored
for the life of the mesh, so scaling the distance back reproduces the unstretched RSSI to the bit:

| stretch | links at 1.0 | still links | lost to the cliff | marginal now | total cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.00 | 545 | 545 | 0 (0.000) | 182 (0.334) | 0.334 |
| 1.25 | 545 | 377 | 168 (0.308) | 158 (0.290) | 0.598 |
| 1.50 | 545 | 249 | 296 (0.543) | 104 (0.191) | 0.734 |
| 2.00 | 545 | 128 | 417 (0.765) | 59 (0.108) | 0.873 |
| 3.00 | 545 | 51 | 494 (0.906) | 16 (0.029) | 0.936 |

**`lost_to_cliff` dominates, and that is the finding, not an artefact.** This model degrades a link
until it reaches sensitivity and then deletes it, so most of what stretching costs is invisible to the
delivery curve. A third of links are already marginal at rest under the thermal floor (0.334 at
stretch 1.0). Letting sub-sensitivity pairs deliver probabilistically would move the balance from
`lost_to_cliff` toward `marginal_now`, and it is a change to the vendored physics.

### 5.1f Noise profiles: a floor that moves

`--noise-model` sets the static floor (§5.1d). `--noise-profile` varies it in time. All three are
hashed from the seed rather than drawn from the RNG, so switching one on leaves every other draw in
the run exactly where it was - the arms of a noise sweep differ in the field and in nothing else - and
the field does not depend on the order the event loop happens to run in.

**`temporal`** is a smooth field with a coherence time τ, and a packet is judged on the **worst**
excursion its own airtime spans, not the mean. A frame is decoded as one unit: a single deep fade
anywhere inside it corrupts enough coded symbols to fail the frame. The length penalty that falls out
is superlinear, where the vendored curve's is a flat 0.8 dB per 100 bytes. At σ=3 dB, τ=500 ms, the
mean worst excursion a full payload meets:

| preset | airtime at 237 B | mean worst excursion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SHORT_TURBO` | 0.175 s | +0.27 dB |
| `LONG_FAST` | 3.62 s | +3.21 dB |
| `LONG_SLOW` | 20.98 s | +5.77 dB |

τ is the knob that controls this. Set it near a short packet's airtime and the length effect
disappears; measured over a 6 h run, τ=500 ms costs 7992 receptions to excursions and τ=30 s costs
3345, because at 30 s a packet sees a flat offset it is as likely to gain from as to lose to.

**`periodic`** is a regular emitter that **wipes out whatever is in flight when it fires** - not an
SNR penalty, a hard loss. The chance of being caught is `(airtime + pulse) / interval`, so it needs no
coefficient and it is the hardest length penalty of the three. At a 10 s interval and a 200 ms pulse:

| preset | airtime at 237 B | frames wiped |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SHORT_TURBO` | 0.175 s | 3.7% |
| `SHORT_FAST` | 0.351 s | 5.3% |
| `LITE_FAST` | 2.22 s | 23.2% |
| `LONG_FAST` | 3.62 s | 37.4% |
| `LONG_MODERATE` | 11.67 s | **100%** |

A frame longer than the interval cannot dodge it. This is the measurement that decides whether a
preset is usable near an interferer at all, and it is why the slow presets are not a free choice.
Mesh-wide and perfectly regular: one emitter every receiver hears, with no jitter, because that is the
adversarial case - a mesh cannot average it away.

**`transient`** is episodic and spatial: a window of raised floor over part of the map. Nothing extra
is needed to make it bite the stretched links first, because a fixed dB excursion removes the least
margin first.

Transient excursions only ever raise the floor. A band quieter than nominal is the temporal
field's business - its excursion can fall below zero on its own, and `saved_by_quiet_band` counts
the packets that arrived because of it. **For lift, use ducting** (§5.1g): a floor-only model can
improve a link that already exists but can never create one, because `neighbours` is thresholded
on static RSSI, and lift that does not extend the graph is not the interesting half.

### 5.1g Tropospheric ducting - `--duct-per-hour`

Episodes when links far beyond normal range come alive: over water, under a temperature inversion, on
a still evening, signal arrives 10-30 dB stronger than the path loss says it should. Kept separate
from the noise profiles because it is the propagation path improving, not the floor moving. It
**does** extend the link graph - a candidate set of sub-sensitivity pairs is built at construction
and filtered by the lift in force - which is why it is the only lift mechanism here.

**A duct is not a gift, and reading it as extra reach misses the result.** Over 12 h, 30 nodes:

| | receptions | collisions | ducted receptions | median node channel util | quietest node |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| no duct | 107063 | 34452 | 0 | 19.5% | 0.4% |
| 1/hour at 25 dB | 133036 | 40896 | 19985 | 30.4% | **16.0%** |
| 2/hour at 30 dB | 343407 | 56609 | 231177 | | |

Receptions rise 24% and collisions rise 19% with them. The quietest node in the mesh goes from 0.4%
to 16.0% channel utilisation - it now hears the whole mesh, and the congestion machinery is being fed
a node count that is not really there. Interferers carry the same lift, so the extra audience contends
and collides rather than arriving into a channel that has gone magically quiet.

The interesting result is what happens **after**. A duct is learned: NodeDB entries, relay bytes and
`next_hop` records written through links that exist for half an hour and then do not. Read
`ducted_receptions` beside `lost_to_collision`, and `next_hop` staleness after the episode closes.

One lift figure for the whole mesh, which is the simplification - a real duct has a geometry and
favours paths along it, usually over water.

### 5.2 Archive placement - `--place`

| Value               | Where the archives go                                                   |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `spread`            | farthest-point across the area                                          |
| `routers`           | on the highest-degree routers                                           |
| `alternate-routers` | every other router by degree                                            |
| `beside-router`     | a plain client one hop from each router                                 |
| `random-clients`    | ordinary nodes at random - the control for every deliberate arrangement |
| `hops-apart`        | targeting `--hops-apart` pairwise separation                            |

**Known limitation:** `hops-apart` picks greedily from a high-degree start, which on a `chain` walks
only a short way along it. On a 24 km chain with 8 archives it clusters them in the left third and
strands 25 of 112 nodes with no archive in reach. A chain-aware placement that spreads along the
principal axis does not exist yet, and testing sync quality on such a mesh would measure the placement
instead.

### 5.1h Batumi: what the only real snapshot is, and what it must not be asked

`--scenario batumi` is the one real mesh in the tree, and every geometry-dependent result rests on
it. Four facts decide what a Batumi run can be quoted for. All are read straight from
`presets/batumi.yaml`.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **92 nodes, 55 unique coordinates** | 43 of them share a position with another; the three largest stacks hold 14, 13 and 10. Stacked nodes are separated by `path_loss_distance_floor_m: 780` and the fitted model, not by their geometry |
| **4 routers** | `--place routers` and `--place beside-router` cap here, and `alternate-routers` at 2. Above the cap a `--servers` sweep silently repeats the capped row - read `servers_placed`, never the requested count |
| **296 observed links, longest 23.2 km** | The fitted budget's envelope. Its ground-elevation terms are positive and unbounded against a log-distance penalty, so past the observed range two hilltop nodes gain more from elevation than distance takes away and the fit invents a link. `pairs_beyond_calibration` counts what fell back to the raw budget |
| **Its own roles, hop limits and node count** | The snapshot supplies them, so `--nodes`, `--role-mix` and `--router-fraction` are inert here and `--stretch` is refused outright |

`--mirror` tiles it into reflected copies to ask what a bigger mesh of the same place does. Every
seam-spanning pair is outside the calibration envelope by construction, so at `--mirror 4` most of
the geometry is answered by the raw budget rather than the fit; read `pairs_beyond_calibration`
before reading anything else in a mirrored run.

There is no better real data available: every branch of the upstream repository carries this same
file. The live-map path (`--scenario map --bbox`) is the route to more.

## 6. Presets change reception, not just airtime

Same 60 nodes, same positions, only `--preset` changed:

| Preset           | Sensitivity | Links | Degree | Diameter       | Isolated | Airtime (53 B) |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ----- | ------ | -------------- | -------- | -------------- |
| `SHORT_FAST`     | −121.5      | 105   | 3.5    | **fragmented** | **3**    | 111 ms         |
| `MEDIUM_FAST`    | −126.5      | 160   | 5.3    | 10             | 1        | 353 ms         |
| `LONG_FAST`      | −131.5      | 259   | 8.7    | 7              | 0        | 1190 ms        |
| `LONG_MODERATE`  | −134.5      | 355   | 11.8   | 5              | 0        | 3609 ms        |
| `LONG_SLOW`      | −137.0      | 449   | 15.0   | 5              | 0        | 6431 ms        |
| `VERY_LONG_SLOW` | −140.0      | 576   | 19.2   | 4              | 0        | 11289 ms       |

Preset feeds four paths: **sensitivity → the link graph** (18.5 dB across the range, so 105 links
against 576 on identical geometry - the dominant effect), airtime → contention → collisions, coding
rate → PER, and SF/bandwidth → CSMA slot time. A preset change is a different _mesh_, not just a
different clock. At `SHORT_FAST` this geometry does not stay connected at all, which is why the
diameter column reads fragmented rather than a number.

| `traffic`      | the largest section, and the one that grows. Includes **`cancelled_by_weaker_relay`** and **`cancelled_reach_lost`** - duplicate suppression backfiring, where the relay heard by fewer nodes silences the one heard by more. Offered load and airtime (originated per class, **`channel_utilisation`** and **`node_channel_util_percent`** - two different things, see below - transmissions, **`queue_drops`**, `dropped_to_backoff_cap`, receptions, collision, half-duplex and PHY losses, congestion coefficient), then one family per mechanism: next-hop routing (`next_hop_*`, `route_expired_*`, `routes_lost_to_eviction`), the NodeDB tiers (`nodedb_evictions`, `warm_*`, `dm_blocked_no_key`), signing (`packets_signed`, `dropped_unsigned_strict`, `dropped_unverifiable`, `dropped_downgrade`, `signature_bootstraps`), traceroute (`traceroutes_sent`, `traceroute_routes_learned`, `traceroute_uncorroborated`, `route_cache_*`), hop scaling (`hop_samples`, `hop_rolls`, `hop_limit_lowered`), and the unreleased mechanisms (`extra_repeats_*`, `early_floods`) |
| `by_class`     | per portnum: sent, received, **per-node reception distribution**, `nodes_receiving_none`, airtime share, `archived`                                                                                                   |
| `by_hop_limit` | reception and hops traversed, split by the node's own limit                                                                                                                                                           |
| `baseline`     | text reach min/median/mean/max, routing ceiling, and the loss split into beyond-hop-limit against lost-within-reach                                                                                                   |
| `designated`   | the archive-sited nodes' own reception, with the archive off or on, plus held and the reconciled gain                                                                                                                 |

| `sfpp`         | held, union, adverts, objects moved, bytes and airtime by message type, decode failures, misdecodes, escalations, bystander pickups, **`silent_losses`**, the at-rest audit, drift telemetry, and the stretch metrics |
| `admin`        | per hop of separation, and **per session rather than per request** - a change that took on the third press is a change that took: `sessions`, `requests_sent`, `attempts_per_session`, `request_delivered`, `session_completed`, `success_rate`, `completed_on_attempt` (everything in `1` means the retries are dead weight), and **`failed_because`** splitting `no_key` / `request_lost` / `reply_lost`, counted once per failed session on its final attempt. `keys_preloaded` records the assumption. Present only with `--admin-probes-per-hour` |
| `dm`           | direct messages, judged **at the node addressed** - `composed`, `delivered`, `reception`, `lost`, plus `no_key` and `no_addressable_peer` (nobody in the node list yet) and `reception_of_attempted` over all three outcomes. `hops` and `latency_ms` distributions at the recipient, and the population - `eligible_nodes` / `originating_nodes` / `emitting_nodes`. Present only with `--dm-per-hour` |
| `link_quality` | every directed link graded by margin over sensitivity: `comfortable` (≥10 dB), `adequate` (5-10), **`fragile`** (<5, so a little fading removes it), plus **`one_way_links`** (heard one way only - the amplifier signature) and `near_miss` (pairs within 6 dB *below* sensitivity, i.e. what the cliff hides) |
| `hops_away`    | how far away each node's NodeDB believes its peers are, against the topology's own answer - the belief and the truth side by side                                                                                    |
| `hop_scaling`  | the firmware's hop histogram: truth, what a node observed, and what its estimator inferred per hop, plus the recommendation it would make                                                                            |
| `adaptive`     | the per-node time series `--trace-interval-s` collects. Empty unless that flag is set                                                                                                                                |
| `opts`         | every resolved option, so a report can be replayed without the command line that made it                                                                                                                            |

`seed`, `label`, `transport` (the commit that produced the run) and `wall_seconds` sit at the top
level beside these.

**Two utilisation figures, and they answer different questions.** Confusing them overstates
congestion badly, because spatial reuse means most transmissions never overlap at any one receiver.

| Field | Is | Range |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `channel_utilisation` | every node's transmit time summed, over elapsed time - **aggregate demand**, not a busy fraction. 1.0 is one channel-second asked for per second | unbounded; above 1 is normal on a mesh with spatial reuse |
| `node_channel_util_percent` | `AirTime::channelUtilizationPercent` per node, as a distribution: six ten-second buckets charging every packet the node could hear above the CAD floor, decoded or not, plus its own transmissions. **What a real device reports, and what sizes its contention window** | 0-100 |

On one 60-node 8 km mesh the two read 1.9x and a 25% median respectively. Quote the second when
asking whether a mesh is busy; quote the first when asking what a change did to total airtime.
Sampled on a cadence during the run, because the ring covers sixty seconds and a single read after
the last packet returns zero.

**Stretch metrics** - the ones that answer "was this worth it on a wide mesh":

- `structurally_unreachable` - no path within the _sender's_ hop limit exists, so nothing would ever
  have delivered it
- `recoverable_from_reachable_archive` - unreachable, but held by an archive the node can reach
- `delivered_though_unreachable` - **unreachable and the node has it anyway.** Proof of
  archive-delivered coverage, not an inference from what a server holds
- `per_node_share_of_unreachable_delivered` and `nodes_with_zero_delivered` - the tail, because the
  mean is dragged up by nodes that had little to recover

### 7.2 What counts as success

Four questions, four denominators. **They are not comparable to each other**, and the commonest
misreading of this tool is treating one as a proxy for another. Each is a primary line on the text
report.

| Metric | The question | Denominator |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `baseline.text_reception_mean` | of all nodes, what share received a broadcast? | every node, every broadcast |
| `dm.reception` | did the DM reach **the one node it was addressed to**? | DMs that reached the air |
| `admin.<hops>.success_rate` | did the operator's change take, within the attempts they made? | sessions the operator wanted |
| `sfpp.held_fraction_mean` | what does an archive **hold**? | objects originated |

A worked example, one 3 h Batumi run: text reach 0.873, DM success 0.966, admin 0.760 at one hop,
archive held 0.933. The DM figure being higher than the broadcast figure does **not** mean DMs work
better - a DM needs to reach one node and gets acknowledgements and retries, while text reach is the
fraction of *all* nodes that heard it. Different denominators, not a comparison.

**Each question separates its own failure modes**, which is the part a single rate cannot do:

- **Broadcast** splits reachability from loss. `reach_ceiling_mean` is what was reachable at all,
  `missed_beyond_hop_limit` is what no hop limit could have carried, `missed_within_reach` is what
  was reachable and lost anyway. The example run reads 1.000 / 0.000 / 0.127 - everything was
  reachable, nothing died to the hop limit, and all the loss was contention. That triple answers
  "would more hops help", which the mean alone cannot.
- **DM** splits `delivered` from `no_key` (never composed - the sender holds no key for the peer) and
  `no_addressable_peer` (the sender's node list was empty, which is the state a fresh node is in
  before nodeinfo spreads). Only the first is a mesh failure; the other two never reached the air.
- **Admin** splits `request_lost` from `reply_lost`, so an asymmetric session failure is visible. In
  the example run, 1 hop failed 4 outbound against 2 return - the request leg is the weaker one, and
  a rate alone would have hidden which. `attempts_per_session` says what the successes cost.

**The safety gate must read zero.** `sfpp.silent_losses` is the design-falsifying counter, and the
text report prints `← STOP, this falsifies the design` beside it if it is not. Read it with
`audit_checksum_agrees_sets_differ` (the at-rest audit disagreeing with the checksum), `misdecodes`
and `decode_failures`. A run with a good reception figure and a non-zero silent-loss count is not a
good run.

**Loss attribution counters are opportunities, not rates.** `lost_to_collision`,
`lost_to_phy`, `lost_to_half_duplex`, `lost_to_noise_excursion`, `queue_drops`, `hops_exhausted`,
`next_hop_unresolved`, `reliable_failures` all count **per reception opportunity**: one broadcast
heard by fifty nodes can produce fifty collision losses. The example run shows 207,917 collision
losses alongside a healthy 0.873 reach, and that is not a contradiction. What the counters are good
for is the *ratio* between them - `lost_to_collision` far exceeding `lost_to_phy` says the mesh is
contention-limited rather than range-limited, which is a different problem with a different fix.

**One metric here is not user-facing success.** `held` and `union` are what an archive *has*. There
is no client hydration path, so nothing measures a user asking a server for what they missed; the
only measured end-user gain from the archive is bystander pickup. Every other metric on this page is
a delivery measurement. That one is inventory.

### 7.3 Reading it

Every per-node quantity is `min / p10 / median / mean / p90 / max`. **Prefer the worst node to the
mean**: on a stretched mesh the result is bimodal - nodes near an archive gain a great deal, nodes past
the last archive gain nothing - and a mean describes neither.

### 7.4 The report and the charts

Both are written by the run itself, into `reports/` and `figures/` beside the JSON, so an unattended
run leaves a complete result and no post-processing step to forget. `--no-charts` skips only the
charts; the JSON and the text report are written either way.

The report is the per-portnum statistics with the archived class marked and listed first, then the
four delivery figures of §7.2 as primary lines - text reach, the routing ceiling and its loss split,
DM success with its failure split and recipient-side hops and latency, and admin success per hop of
separation with `failed_because` and what the successes cost in attempts - followed by what only an
archive could have delivered, and the `silent_losses` gate. The two utilisation distributions get a
line each, because they answer different questions over different windows.
The charts are per-class reception spread with the worst node marked, airtime by class, and the
stretch metrics where present - each footered with the transport commit, seed and duration, so a
figure cannot be read against the wrong code.

## 8. Two checks that would have caught real bugs on day one

The full list is [TRAPS.md](TRAPS.md) - ten defects that each produced a plausible wrong number,
with the assertion that would have caught each and where that assertion lives now. These two are
here because they were in the JSON all along and were read past for three rounds.


Both of these are in the JSON and both were ignored for three rounds:

- **`queue_drops` against `transmissions`.** A backoff cap was discarding about two thirds of all
  rebroadcast attempts, including the archive's own packets, and every airtime figure from rounds one
  to three was measured through it.
- **Identical rows across a swept arm.** Two arms have been silently inert - accepted on the command
  line, stored, never read - and both produced well-formed tables supporting the opposite of the truth.
  Every discrete flag has since been run on both sides and its reports diffed, so none is inert now;
  the ones that need a second flag before they do anything are listed in §10.4, and a sweep over one
  of those without its enabler produces exactly the same symptom.

And the standing one: **`silent_losses` must be zero.** A checksum that closes over two unequal sets
would falsify the design. Across roughly 280 runs, two bucket regimes and both protocols, it never has.

## 9. Register: what this iteration is built from

Four separate bodies of work, none of them ours alone. Recorded here so credit is attributable and a
re-sync is a diff rather than an archaeology exercise.

**Komzpa's stack is the reason there is a credible radio model at all.** Upstream `master` still carries
2.1-era physics; the SRTM terrain, OSM land-cover clutter, capture-aware physics with a real collision
model, and the dynamic coding-rate and TX-power policies are all PR #77, which itself stacks powersjcb's
preset sync from PR #33. None of it is merged upstream, so vendoring it was a fork-and-own decision - see
`sim/meshtasticator/UPSTREAM` for the exact merge, the one conflict resolved (`batchSim.py`, upstream #83's
keyword-argument form kept), and the re-sync recipe. PR #78's Burning Man scenario is **not** included.

**What of it this transport actually calls**, because vendoring is not using and the difference
decides what a result rests on:

| Komzpa module                                     | Called? | Where                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `lib/terrain.py`, `lib/srtm.py`                   | yes     | `--scenario`, via `sfpp/terrain.py` (§5.1h)    |
| `lib/clutter.py`, `lib/osm_clutter.py`            | yes     | same - and the larger of the two terms on Batumi |
| `lib/phy.py`, `lib/radio_loss.py`, `lib/config.py` | yes     | the link budget and the PER curve, throughout  |
| link calibration (in `radio_loss`)                | yes     | scenario-carried, refusable with `--no-link-calibration` |
| `lib/dcr.py` (dynamic coding rate)                | **no**  | `--coding-rate-ladder` is an unreleased branch's behaviour, not this |
| `lib/dtp.py` (dynamic TX power)                   | **no**  | not modelled                                   |
| `lib/link_model.py`                               | partly  | its decomposition is reproduced in `_build_links` so this transport's own per-node gains and per-pair skew survive; the function itself is not called |

The other direction works too: a scenario composes with everything this transport added, so
`--scenario batumi --noise-profile all --duct-per-hour 1 --profile 2.4 --legacy-fraction 0.3` is a
single run over real geometry and real ground.

`sim/sfpp/analytic/` is a fifth, independent line: a closed-form model kept deliberately separate as a
cross-check on the event simulator rather than folded into it.

### 9.1 Firmware versions the transport can imitate

`--profile` selects which firmware's rules to obey - a **release series**, taken at the final release
of that series:

| Profile  | What arrives in that series                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `2.4`    | the floor. CW 2-8, SNR range to 15 dB, router offset, quantised slots, utilisation backoff, reliable retransmission at 3 attempts, a flat 100-entry NodeDB and a flat congestion coefficient  |
| `2.5`    | the late-rebroadcast window and the queue ordering that goes with it (late first, relayed preferred), `ROUTER_LATE`, `CORE_PORTNUMS_ONLY`, CW 2-7, congestion scaled per preset                |
| `2.6`    | next-hop routing, CW floor to 3, SNR range narrowed to 10 dB, per-board NodeDB sizing                                                                                                          |
| `2.7`    | next-hop and traceroute **learning**, role-aware cancellation, `CLIENT_BASE`, favourite-and-base early rebroadcast, hop preservation and hop upgrade, congestion scaled on SF and bandwidth    |
| `2.8`    | this tree. Traceroute corroboration, the overflow route cache, last-byte ambiguity resolution, RouteHealth, the warm store, packet signing, the hop-scaling histogram and its recommendation, opaque relay, congestion clamp, 5 unicast attempts |
| `legacy` | this transport's own pre-fold-in model - **not a firmware version.** Four of its deviations were never any firmware's behaviour (no router offset, a continuous slot draw, a clamped contention window, a 400-backoff discard), so it must not be read as "2.7 and earlier" |

Each row is **cumulative**: a profile carries everything from the rows above it. A version was dated
by walking the firmware's own release tags for the commit that introduced the behaviour, so the date
is evidence; the claim that nothing else in that series matters is the assumption (§10.2).

`--old-profile` and `--legacy-fraction` run a share of the nodes on a different series, for a
mixed-version mesh. `--profile-flag NAME=VALUE` overrides a single rule, which is where a specific
pathology belongs rather than as a profile of its own.

Three mechanisms are **not in any release** and are switched on explicitly: `--extra-repeats`
(branch `extra-repeats`), `--coding-rate-ladder` (branch `CRCRRCRRR`), and `--dm-mode m4-early-flood`
(written and compiled out at `NEXTHOP_EARLY_FLOOD_ON_UNVERIFIED 0`).

The vendored Meshtasticator's own 2.1-era physics remains reachable in `sim/meshtasticator/` for
comparison, but the SF++ transport does not model behaviour older than `2.4`.

## 10. What is simplified, assumed, or not there at all

Every result from this tool is bounded by this section. Three categories, and the difference matters:
**simplified** means the mechanism is present but coarser than the firmware; **assumed** means a
number was chosen rather than measured, and choosing differently would move results; **absent** means
the mechanism is not modelled at all and any question about it has no answer here.

### 10.1 Simplified

| Thing                     | What the firmware does                                           | What this does                                                                                                                        |

| Packet encoding           | protobuf, with field-by-field sizes                              | payload lengths are computed from the wire layout, but nothing is serialised. Length is right; encoding cost is not modelled          |

### 10.2 Assumed

| Assumption                     | Value                                            | Why it matters                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Siting gain** (`--siting-mix`) | roof +6, desk 0, pocket −10, basement −20 dB   | **Not from the firmware and not measured.** The firmware has no concept of siting at all. 26 dB between roof and basement is wide enough to move any result. The default `uniform` is all-desk, i.e. 0 dB, so a run that does not set this flag is unaffected |
| Link asymmetry                 | per-node transmit and receive gain, plus a per-pair Gaussian σ 2 dB | `rssi[i][j]` takes `tx_gain[i] + rx_gain[j]`, so an amplified node is heard where it cannot hear. Siting moves both directions together (a basement is bad to transmit from and to receive in); amplification does not. The amplifier figures are **assumed, not measured** - the firmware knows `tx_power` and nothing about what is bolted to the antenna port |
| **Noise floor** (`--noise-model`) | `thermal`: kTB + 6 dB NF for the preset's bandwidth. `fixed`: the vendored single constant | The vendored `NOISE_LEVEL` is one number, −119.25 dBm, for every preset - but the sensitivity table beside it is not. Those figures are kTB + 6 dB NF, and each lands **exactly** on its spreading factor's demodulator limit (SF7 −7.5 dB, SF11 −17.5, SF12 −20.0). A fixed floor therefore misstates SNR by 10·log₁₀(bw/anchor): roughly **5 dB optimistic at 250 kHz and 8 dB at 500 kHz.** `thermal` is the default; `fixed` reproduces runs made before this existed |
| **No marginal link** - but delivery *is* probabilistic | every reception draws against `payload_success_probability(rssi, cr, length)`; only pairs above sensitivity are ever attempted | The draw is real and the coding rate reaches it, so a retransmission at a higher CR genuinely is more likely to land. What is missing is the *range*: `neighbours` is thresholded at sensitivity, where the vendored curve already sits at 96%, and it saturates at 99.5% by +3 dB of margin. So the whole probabilistic band is 0.96-0.995, and **a link that works a third of the time cannot exist here at all**. Consequences worth knowing: PHY loss is around 0.7% of reception attempts against 28% to collisions, so contention dominates weak links by a factor of ~56; and raising the coding rate from 5 to 8 buys +0.030 at zero margin, +0.004 at +2 dB and **exactly nothing at +3 dB or more**, which bounds what any CR-ladder result can show. `link_quality.fragile` (margin under 5 dB) and `near_miss` (within 6 dB below sensitivity) size what the threshold hides: 207 against 342 on a stock 60-node mesh. Letting sub-sensitivity pairs deliver probabilistically is the fix, and it is a change to the vendored physics |
| Path loss                      | 3GPP Suburban Macro (`MODEL = 5`)                | one propagation environment for every run. No terrain, no clutter, no per-link environment                                         |
| Diurnal shape                  | `commuter`, 17:1 peak-to-trough                  | invented, not measured. It sets when the mesh is busy, which the whole congestion story rests on                                    |
| Role and board census          | `baymesh-2026-08`, 1769 real nodes               | measured, but from one metro mesh on one day. Not a global distribution                                                            |
| Profiles `2.4`–`2.7`           | dated by walking the firmware's release tags     | the *date* a behaviour first appeared is evidence; the claim that nothing else changed in that series is not. A profile is a floor - the named behaviours are off, everything unnamed is left at 2.8 |
| Hop-scaling estimator          | firmware arithmetic, exhaustive count as control | the estimator is ported exactly; what a real mesh's hop histogram looks like is the assumption                                      |

### 10.3 Not included

Nothing below is modelled. A question about any of it has no answer here, and a result that would
depend on it is not evidence.

- **No client hydration path.** Archives reconcile with each other; nothing models a client asking a
  server for what it missed, so `held` and `union` are what an archive _has_, not what a user _gets_.
  The only measured end-user gain is bystander pickup.
- **No duty cycle enforcement.** Airtime figures are what the protocol asks for, not what a region
  permits. A run can and does exceed what is legal to transmit.
- **No MQTT, no internet-connected nodes**, and so no packets arriving without RF provenance beyond
  the one place the traceroute guard tests for them.
- **No terrain and no clutter _unless `--scenario` asks for them_** (§5.1h). Without it the world is
  flat and the link budget is distance alone, which is what every run before this assumed. With it,
  Komzpa's SRTM terrain and OSM land-cover code is called for real. Two things to know before
  quoting a terrain result: the packaged Batumi grid is 42 samples over a 16 km extent, which is
  coarse enough that terrain there costs 4.3 dB per pair against clutter's 13.7 and changes which
  pairs are links **not at all**; and a synthetic landform is a plausible shape of ground, not a
  real place, so it prices *having terrain* rather than *having that terrain*.
- **No mobility.** Positions are drawn once and never change.
- **No power model**: no sleep, no battery, no duty-cycled receivers. Every node is listening at all
  times, which overstates reception on any mesh with sleeping clients.
- **No dynamic TX power or dynamic coding rate** as shipped policies - `--coding-rate-ladder` is an
  unreleased branch's behaviour, not the vendored dynamic-CR code, which is also not called.
- **No admin messages, no channel or PSK model, no position precision, no NeighborInfo module.**
- **No firmware-side store and forward**: the SF++ archive here is the campaign's own protocol, not
  the shipped StoreForward module.
- **No regulatory regions beyond the vendored preset table**, and no per-region duty or power policy
  beyond `power_limit`.

### 10.4 Flags that do nothing on their own

Each of these is live, but only once the flag that enables it is set. A sweep over one of them
without its enabling flag produces well-formed identical rows - which is exactly the failure mode
§8 warns about.

| Flag                            | Does nothing unless                                       |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--old-profile`                 | `--legacy-fraction` is above 0                            |
| `--dm-mode`                     | `--dm-transport transport`                                |
| `--coding-rate-ladder`          | there are addressed messages to retransmit, so in practice `--dm-transport transport` with `--traceroute-per-hour` above 0 |
| `--no-adopt-hop-recommendation` | the run is long enough and large enough for a node to reach a recommendation at all |
| `--platform-mix`                | `--max-num-nodes` is left unset - an explicit value overrides every board's own size |
| `--advert-max-interval-s`       | `--trigger aimd`                                          |
| `--window-size`                 | `--bucket-mode window`                                    |
| `--time-bucket-s`               | `--bucket-mode time`                                      |
| `--hops-apart`                  | `--place hops-apart`                                      |
| `--chain-walk-cap`              | `--protocol chain`                                        |
| the `adaptive` JSON section     | `--trace-interval-s` is above 0                           |
| `--hop-spread`                  | nothing - it is already the default. `--no-hop-spread` is the control |
