"""SF++ set reconciliation over a real mesh: server placement, the protocol, and what it costs.

Every message the protocol sends is a packet on the transport in mesh.py: an advert contends for the
channel, is relayed by nodes that gain nothing from it, and is lost when it collides. What this
measures is what the protocol costs and where the servers should go.

Three arms are swept independently:

  trigger   when an advert is worth sending    bucket-close / fixed interval / AIMD
  resolve   how a difference is resolved       sketch-as-request / explicit enumeration / hybrid
  place     where the servers are              spread / routers / every other router / beside a
                                               router / a fixed number of hops apart

Usage, from sim/:
    python3 -m sfpp.campaign --hours 6 --place spread --servers 3 --capacity 32
    python3 -m sfpp.campaign --baseline            # no SF++ at all: what does the mesh alone lose?
