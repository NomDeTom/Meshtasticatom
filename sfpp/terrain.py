"""Hills, valleys, land cover and real node geometry, for the SF++ transport.

Everything in this file is an adapter onto code that already exists in `sim/meshtasticator/lib/` -
Komzpa's SRTM terrain, OSM land-cover clutter and the fitted link-calibration model from
Meshtasticator PR #77. None of it is reimplemented here. The vendored functions are called with the
vendored `Config` fields set the way the vendored simulator sets them, so a link budget computed
through this file and one computed by `loraMesh.py --preset batumi` differ only where this transport
deliberately differs (its own MAC, its own noise floor when `--noise-model thermal` is left on).

What this file adds is the three things that stood between that code and this simulator:

  * **a scenario**, so a run can take its node geometry from a real mesh instead of drawing points
    in a square. `batumi` is the packaged one; `map` pulls the public map and cuts a bounding box
    out of it, which is how Komzpa's original scenarios were built;
  * **a terrain source for a mesh that is not a real place.** A generated topology has no elevation
    to look up, and "3.2 km of reach in every direction" is the assumption a flat model makes.
    `synthetic` puts ridges and valleys under a generated mesh so the shape of the ground is a
    variable rather than a constant, and it is hashed rather than drawn so switching it on does not
    move the traffic schedule (the same discipline `NoiseField` follows, and for the same reason);
  * **an index**, because `TerrainGrid.elevation_at` sorts every sample on every call. That is fine
    for the packaged 78-point Batumi grid and unusable for an SRTM tile: a 60-node mesh asks for
    85 000 elevations before it has sent a packet. `IndexedTerrainGrid` answers the identical
    inverse-distance question over a bucketed candidate set, and `test_terrain_index_matches_vendored`
    holds it to the vendored answer.

The three loss terms stay separable on purpose, because they are three different claims and the
register has to be able to price them apart:

  | term                | flag                    | what it says                                          |
  | ------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
  | terrain             | `--terrain`             | a ridge is between these two nodes                    |
  | clutter             | `--clutter`             | the path crosses apartment blocks, forest, or water   |
  | link calibration    | `--link-calibration`    | a ridge fit against 296 observed Batumi links         |

`--scenario batumi` turns on all three, since that is the combination the coefficients were fitted
under and the only one where the calibration term means anything. Any of them can be turned off
again to ask what that term alone was worth.

    The vendored grid sorts all N samples by distance on every lookup and keeps the nearest eight

    and widens a ring until it can prove no unexamined bucket can hold a closer sample than the
    eighth it already has - so the candidate set is a superset of the vendored nearest eight, and
    the weighting that follows is the vendored one applied to the same eight points.
