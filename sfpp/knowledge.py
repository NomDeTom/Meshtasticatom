"""What each node knows, what it has forgotten, and what that costs when the mesh breaks.

The transport models the firmware's bounded stores: a NodeDB capped at MAX_NUM_NODES and a packet
history of twice that. Both silently discard things. This module is the instrument for that - it
samples what every node holds, and answers the questions the caps actually raise:

- **Does the mesh fit?** A 60-node mesh does not fit in an STM32WL's ten slots, so its routing sees
  a different mesh from the one that exists.
- **What is a route worth?** A learned next hop can be lost three different ways on three different
  clocks, and only one of them is the 30-minute TTL people quote - plus a fourth thing that looks
  like a loss in the counters and is not one, an ambiguous relay byte refusing to resolve.
- **What survives a break?** After a partition or a node failure, how much of what the mesh knew is
  still true, and how long does it take to notice it is not?

`snapshot()` is cheap enough to call on a timer; `Recorder` does that and keeps the series.
`render()` draws it. Nothing here mutates the mesh.
