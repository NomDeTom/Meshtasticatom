"""How often is it worth advertising, and is advertising worth it at all?

Two questions this answers, both in *total mesh airtime*, which is what duty cycle and
channel utilisation actually care about:

  1. Push or pull? A sketch exchange can end with the behind node *requesting* what it
     lacks, or with the ahead node simply *sending* it. XORing two sketches yields the
     symmetric difference as a set of short IDs; a node splits that set by looking each ID
     up locally - the ones it holds are what the peer lacks, so it pushes those, and the
     ones it does not hold are what it lacks itself. No request is needed in either
     direction, and one advert resolves both ways at once.

  2. How many adverts per new message? Advertising is paid by every node on every
     interval whether or not anything changed: N nodes at f adverts an hour costs
     N * f * advert bytes. Repetition is paid once by the sender and heard by everyone:
     lambda messages at k copies costs lambda * k * object. The first scales with the
     size of the mesh, the second does not - which is the whole argument, and it does not
     favour advertising.

The comparison that matters is not "which is cheaper" but "cheaper for what recovery
window". Repetition only helps a node that was listening while the copies went out. A
node that was off for six hours needs either a repeat schedule spanning six hours or a
reconciliation exchange when it returns.
