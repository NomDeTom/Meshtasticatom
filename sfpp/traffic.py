"""The offered load: what a Meshtastic channel actually carries, not just the part SF++ archives.

Reconciliation cost only means something against the traffic it shares a channel with. A mesh whose
only packets are text messages would make an advert look expensive; a real one is mostly position
and telemetry, and the archived class is a minority of it. Rates below are per node per hour and
sized so text lands at roughly a seventh of originated packets - what a channel looks like with
telemetry on and a normal share of people talking.

Text is the only archived class. Everything else exists to contend for the channel, to be relayed,
and to be missed - which is what the baseline measures.
