"""The radio underneath the sketch: nodes, links, airtime, collisions, managed flood.

The physics is Meshtasticator's - estimate_path_loss() for who hears whom, airtime() for how long a
packet holds the channel, and its empirical SNR-to-PER curve for marginal links - wrapped in an event
loop implementing the firmware's own rules: CAD before transmit, SNR-weighted rebroadcast delay,
duplicate suppression, and cancelling a pending rebroadcast on hearing someone else do it first.

Where each rule comes from: RadioInterface for the contention window and the retransmission timer,
MeshPacketQueue and RadioLibInterface for queue order and the deferred `tx_after` window,
FloodingRouter for who may cancel a dupe, Router::shouldDecrementHopLimit for when a hop is free,
NextHopRouter for directed delivery and its fallback to flooding.

Profile selects which release series' rules to obey - see Profile for what differs between them.
Everything the SR protocol sends goes through here and is charged for.

        the surviving population looks healthier the further you pull the mesh apart. Measured on a

        re-drawn: the per-pair skew is stored for the life of the mesh, so scaling the distance back

        `relay_node` and `next_hop` are one byte of a 32-bit node number, so on a mesh of any size
        they collide. Callers treat anything but UNIQUE as the safe branch: decrement the hop limit,
        flood instead of unicasting, learn nothing. The two failures are kept apart because they say
        different things - AMBIGUOUS is a dense mesh, NONE is a mesh this node has not learned.

        Two gates decide the candidate set, and both shrink it well below "every node with this
        byte". The candidate gate is the hot store, minus ourselves and any ignored node: an evicted
        or never-heard peer is not a candidate. The relevance gate asks whether the peer is a
        plausible relay for this question - on the send path a direct neighbour heard within two
        hours, otherwise a direct neighbour, a favourite or a router-like node.

        So a smaller store makes the byte less ambiguous rather than more, which is the opposite of
        a birthday bound taken over the whole mesh. A large mesh costs knowledge, not resolution.

        Only this tree scans for a second candidate. Under 2.6 and 2.7 the lookup takes the first
        node it matches and the caller is never told it guessed, which is modelled by returning
        UNIQUE on that first match.

        One fidelity gap: the firmware reads the role recorded in its own `NodeInfoLite`, learned
        from a NodeInfo exchange this model does not run, so the role gate here reads the peer's

        `assume_key` skips the PKI gate for a peer whose key did not come from the hot store. It
        exists for the admin path, and it is firmware-authentic rather than a convenience: admin
        authorisation lives in `config.security.admin_key[3]` - three 32-byte keys in SecurityConfig,
        compared directly at AdminModule.cpp:184 - which is separate persistent config, not NodeDB.
        It is provisioned out of band or baked in via USERPREFS, and it survives every eviction the
        hot store performs. Gating an admin session on NodeDB would measure eviction rather than
        whether the session completes.

        `pki` marks a DM that has to be encrypted to the destination's public key. Without a key in
        any tier the packet is never composed, which is what evicting a peer actually costs: not a
        worse route to it, but no conversation with it until its NodeInfo is heard again.
